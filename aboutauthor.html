    <h2>About the Author</h2>

    <img src="images/abtauthor.jpg" width=200px/>
<p>My name is Samantha Lee. I am a senior at Rutgers University studying Business Analytics and Information Technology, minoring in Technical Writing! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, climbing, reading, and watching movies :)</p>
    <p>For this year, some of my goals are to finish up this semester strong and make sure I make the most of the rest of my time here at Rutgers! This Trash of the Week project has been for my Web Authoring class, giving me a really great chance to explore new languages and experiment with my current coding skills. I hope you enjoy my page, thanks for visiting!</p>
