    <h1>Theory: Expanded Preface</em></h1>

<p>
    With the start of the Lunar New Year on 
    <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/lunar-new-year-dates-animals-zodiac" target="_blank">January 29th</a>, 
    families traditionally clean their homes to remove bad luck and begin the start of a new year– including my own family. 
    After moving away for college, I've noticed I haven't followed this tradition much, a mix of college laziness and timing: 
    after all, the semester has just started and my room would still be (pretty) in order. This year was different– I've just returned from a semester abroad, 
    and had crammed all my things together to rush to college without ever really looking through what I brought! I thought it'd be a good time to do my own impromptu spring cleaning, 
    as a way to bring back a hopeful tradition of spring cleaning as I prepare to move out of college and into an apartment of my own one day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've always been a bit of a sentimental hoarder, so this becomes a sweet little project where I'm able to reflect on my own changes and needs with time. 
    I thought it'd make a more intriguing topic, seeing as all the trash I'm picking out this week holds more sentimental value to me than usual. 
    Being able to let go of these small and pretty insignificant objects while recording them gives me a good way to look back on myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main purpose of starting this project was, at first, to do some reflecting on my own forms of waste and my impact. 
    This was inspired by the thoughts of Newman’s work that focused on the concerns of waste but also as a marking of ‘history’-- 
    similar to her sentiment that “landfills tend to offer ideal conditions for preservation" (Newman). 
    However, as I began to collect my items, I realized that I was already starting to pick out the pieces more significant to me, 
    I started shifting my focus into a digital ‘notebook’ of items that I clearly needed to de-clutter, but still should let go of at some point. 
    Thill’s <em>Reframing Trash Into Art</em> describes this different sentiment to art, shifting it into a “reality of continuity, 
    and about recycling material and meaning as an artistic and social practice”. 
    I began this project thinking of it as a sobering way to track my waste usage, 
    but the limit to nine items each week made me start thinking that it could be an expression of how I live instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    To me, the most important text changing my perspective was Thill’s idea on the fact that digital waste is a byproduct of our modern world. 
    I am someone who gets overwhelmed by online folders and archives of limitless things I’d want to do– 
    but I always thought the solution to be through cleaning of my laptop or something like ‘zero-inbox’, as Thill was talking about. 
    Instead, Thill’s acknowledgment of the fact that digital waste was “cascading microdesires, our wants and needs constantly refreshed, updated, streaming”-- 
    but then, being able to reframe it into a historic archive of each person– ended up resonating with me and my project a lot more.
  </p>

  <p>
    From here, I was able to solidify what I wanted my project to achieve: a digital archive of items and memories that are important to me; 
    which end up acting as a way to declutter my physical space and turn my digital waste into a small art form I’m proud of.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is worth noting, as Professors Tom Jackson, Ian Hodgkinson and Lisa Jackson talk about in their research,
    <em>How digital waste is polluting the planet</em>, that all our waste still has an output: we have “80% of primary business data” 
    not accessed in years, coming from poor management and fear of deleting old data, or how “data centres are processing more than 
    sixteen times as much internet traffic, and house ten-times the computing power”. 
    This shows that even my own saved pictures, bookmarks, and screenshots that I am too lazy to delete are contributing to an output of a real effect on waste and the environment. 
    Since it is so much easier to close my phone, it becomes something I rarely think about. 
    Therefore, I think of this project as a way to mindfully create space on the internet as a form of art, 
    and the added benefit of being able to truly let go of all these items I throw out during my impromptu spring cleaning shows the small benefits. 
    From here, I hope the project inspires me to be more mindful of my digital waste from now on: 
    though I can clear out folders and cookies, it would be much more helpful if I just began to think of my saves and bookmarks differently; 
    and use them more-so with a purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gerry McGovern’s point on how “digital design tools rarely pay attention to weight and waste” changes my perspective a bit, 
    as I realize that I would want to start seeing my digital use as a form of ‘waste’ if I am not doing something useful with it. 
    I would want to start being more aware of times I am saving videos and reels without intention. 
    I always felt that I was more of a ‘consumer’ than a creator, and the process of this project has helped me realize I can make a shift by being more mindful. 
    When the work I am making and producing is important, or something I am proud of– I’m able to throw away physical waste as this project shows, 
    or just feel like my work and space in the digital cloud is something more meaningful to myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    My project is not really an activist or awareness-raising project, but more of a memory for myself that helps me process the idea of really cleaning out my physical space. 
    All the items I have chosen are pretty meaningful to me, or at least things that I cared about at some point. 
    I would say it is more of an art project that is personal to me, but definitely one I am willing to share and put on the internet. 
    I would hope that if someone runs into my project, they would be inspired to do a similar idea that I have. 
    It relates to collecting and cataloging as Thill and Muniz describe, as I acknowledge that my digital waste is still waste– 
    but the archive of my memories and personal connections to each object, or piece of trash, show a story of my own history and life. 
    I would call my project more of a journal than a museum, as it helped me understand my own waste and how I think of it. 
    It’s definitely more exploratory, thinking of how much it has changed and been edited based on the new texts I have read.
