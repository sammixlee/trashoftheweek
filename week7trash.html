  <h2 id="sec-preface">Preface</h2>
  <p>
    With the start of the Lunar New Year on 
    <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/lunar-new-year-dates-animals-zodiac" target="_blank">January 29th</a>, 
    families traditionally clean their homes to remove bad luck and begin the start of a new year– including my own family. 
    After moving away for college, I've noticed I haven't followed this tradition much, a mix of college laziness and timing: 
    after all, the semester has just started and my room would still be (pretty) in order. This year was different– I've just returned from a semester abroad, 
    and had crammed all my things together to rush to college without ever really looking through what I brought! I thought it'd be a good time to do my own impromptu spring cleaning, 
    as a way to bring back a hopeful tradition of spring cleaning as I prepare to move out of college and into an apartment of my own one day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've always been a bit of a sentimental hoarder, so this becomes a sweet little project where I'm able to reflect on my own changes and needs with time. 
    I thought it'd make a more intriguing topic, seeing as all the trash I'm picking out this week holds more sentimental value to me than usual. 
    Being able to let go of these small and pretty insignificant objects while recording them gives me a good way to look back on myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main purpose of starting this project was, at first, to do some reflecting on my own forms of waste and my impact. 
    This was inspired by the thoughts of Newman’s work that focused on the concerns of waste but also as a marking of ‘history’-- 
    similar to her sentiment that “landfills tend to offer ideal conditions for preservation" (Newman). 
    However, as I began to collect my items, I realized that I was already starting to pick out the pieces more significant to me, 
    I started shifting my focus into a digital ‘notebook’ of items that I clearly needed to de-clutter, but still should let go of at some point. 
    Thill’s <em>Reframing Trash Into Art</em> describes this different sentiment to art, shifting it into a “reality of continuity, 
    and about recycling material and meaning as an artistic and social practice”. 
    I began this project thinking of it as a sobering way to track my waste usage, 
    but the limit to nine items each week made me start thinking that it could be an expression of how I live instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    To me, the most important text changing my perspective was Thill’s idea on the fact that digital waste is a byproduct of our modern world. 
    I am someone who gets overwhelmed by online folders and archives of limitless things I’d want to do– 
    but I always thought the solution to be through cleaning of my laptop or something like ‘zero-inbox’, as Thill was talking about. 
    Instead, Thill’s acknowledgment of the fact that digital waste was “cascading microdesires, our wants and needs constantly refreshed, updated, streaming”-- 
    but then, being able to reframe it into a historic archive of each person– ended up resonating with me and my project a lot more.
  </p>

  <p>
    From here, I was able to solidify what I wanted my project to achieve: a digital archive of items and memories that are important to me; 
    which end up acting as a way to declutter my physical space and turn my digital waste into a small art form I’m proud of.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is worth noting, as Professors Tom Jackson, Ian Hodgkinson and Lisa Jackson talk about in their research,
    <em>How digital waste is polluting the planet</em>, that all our waste still has an output: we have “80% of primary business data” 
    not accessed in years, coming from poor management and fear of deleting old data, or how “data centres are processing more than 
    sixteen times as much internet traffic, and house ten-times the computing power”. 
    This shows that even my own saved pictures, bookmarks, and screenshots that I am too lazy to delete are contributing to an output of a real effect on waste and the environment. 
    Since it is so much easier to close my phone, it becomes something I rarely think about. 
    Therefore, I think of this project as a way to mindfully create space on the internet as a form of art, 
    and the added benefit of being able to truly let go of all these items I throw out during my impromptu spring cleaning shows the small benefits. 
    From here, I hope the project inspires me to be more mindful of my digital waste from now on: 
    though I can clear out folders and cookies, it would be much more helpful if I just began to think of my saves and bookmarks differently; 
    and use them more-so with a purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gerry McGovern’s point on how “digital design tools rarely pay attention to weight and waste” changes my perspective a bit, 
    as I realize that I would want to start seeing my digital use as a form of ‘waste’ if I am not doing something useful with it. 
    I would want to start being more aware of times I am saving videos and reels without intention. 
    I always felt that I was more of a ‘consumer’ than a creator, and the process of this project has helped me realize I can make a shift by being more mindful. 
    When the work I am making and producing is important, or something I am proud of– I’m able to throw away physical waste as this project shows, 
    or just feel like my work and space in the digital cloud is something more meaningful to myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    My project is not really an activist or awareness-raising project, but more of a memory for myself that helps me process the idea of really cleaning out my physical space. 
    All the items I have chosen are pretty meaningful to me, or at least things that I cared about at some point. 
    I would say it is more of an art project that is personal to me, but definitely one I am willing to share and put on the internet. 
    I would hope that if someone runs into my project, they would be inspired to do a similar idea that I have. 
    It relates to collecting and cataloging as Thill and Muniz describe, as I acknowledge that my digital waste is still waste– 
    but the archive of my memories and personal connections to each object, or piece of trash, show a story of my own history and life. 
    I would call my project more of a journal than a museum, as it helped me understand my own waste and how I think of it. 
    It’s definitely more exploratory, thinking of how much it has changed and been edited based on the new texts I have read.

  <h2 id="sec-overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
  This week's disposal activity holds many more items of sentimental value as compared to previous weeks which are more of a reflection of my daily trash. Since it's a spring cleaning, these items took me a lot more thought to throw out not, whether it was recorded for this project or not. My view of the project during this week feels much more personal and also made me rethink how much I hold onto even if I don't need them anymore.
  </p>
 
     <p>One surprise I faced was that I was more reluctant to get rid of clothes even though I knew I would never wear them again. I usually bring too many clothes to college because I always think I'll maybe wear them again, but even with that in mind, I found myself still attached to clothes that either don't fit, aren't items I would still wear, or are torn. I always think maybe I could repurpose my old clothes or cut them up for projects but still never find myself doing that. I was surprised by some of the items I chose to still keep, and also how it felt easier getting rid of some clothes when I thought about being able to donate them to a thrift store or pass them down. I split my categories into makeup, clothes, and trinkets. 
 </p>

  <h3>Makeup</h3>
  <p>
   Make-up wise, the first product I threw out is the green-gold Moroccan clay pot lipstick I got earlier this year. I realized the product doesn't work like how I'd like (and has also broken down enough I can't pass it down). I kept it at first as a souvenir from my trip, but realized I really just keep it in my drawer and don't love its look if there's no function. My second item is an old Elf concealer I bought in high school. The picture shows it's clearly expired, but I always put off throwing it out because I felt attached to how I used to use it for special occasions or going out with friends. Another is my favorite Colorpop highlighter that I finished to the pan. Once I got a replacement it was an easier decision to throw out, but I also put it off until I did.
  </p>


  <h3>Clothes</h3>
  <p>
   Clothes-wise, I added in a beret, a white dress, and a hoodie from Cape Cod. The beret I just don't like, a cheap version I got off a website when I was younger– and the white dress no longer fits me anymore. The hoodie holds the most memories for me since I got it on a camping trip with my family, but as I got older I began to condense my souvenir collection into magnets and household items that aren't as variable to me as clothes and how they look on me.  </p>

  <h3>Trinkets</h3>
  <p>
     Lastly, my category of trinkets includes a broken Tamagachi Connect, an old matching cat keychain with my ex-boyfriend, and a Sanrio blind box of a matching figurine I got with him as well. Pictured on the right is my old version of the Tamagachi, which I couldn't bring myself to throw out for the longest time since my sister and I grew up playing on these. Recently there was a re-release of the line, where I bought my sister and me a new one and I finally threw the old one away. The keychains were from early in our relationship and a small item forgotten on the side, tucked into my pencilcase before I went abroad. It felt like a shame to throw them out, but I think it's just personal enough that I wouldn't think about regifting them. Lastly is the Sanrio figure that we got together in the city during this past summer. It's the character KiKi from My Melody's 'Little Twin Stars', and I'd leave it by my desk at work as a little decoration and memento.

<h2 id="sec-itemofweek">Item of the Week</h2>
	  
	      <img src="images/actionshot.jpg" width=200px/>
	  
     <p>My item of the week is my KiKi figurine. I chose it because of the memories attached to it– a close option was the Tamagochi, but so many of my chosen items I only accepted throwing out because I was able to replace them with almost the same option. Nothing is wrong with the figurine itself, but it felt too close of an item to my ex. 
 </p>
     <p>I got this with him in the city– I've never been a huge blind box person but always loved collecting miniature items. When my boyfriend and I both worked in New York, we would see each other whenever we could after work to enjoy the city together. The day we got our figurines was probably one of my favorites of our dates, we usually tried to explore new places but stayed to Times Square since we were tight on time. From there on out, we would send photos of our figurines around the city or our commute that felt like a time to intentionally think on our relationship, as well as slow down for a pretty sunset or view. The action shot is from one of my old commutes back home, which I'd always enjoy as it'd be the perfect time for the sunset. 
 </p>
     <p>This item came from the 'MINISO Sanrio Peekaboo Series "Little Twin Star Kiki" Blind Box' Series, which comes with seven different options. Blind boxes often come with tradable figurines that are hidden within outside packaging. The packaging for this series was a cardboard box, under a 'Peekaboo' line and therefore each figurine has a little box they fit in. The figurine I got, KiKi, is part of the Little Twin Stars duo of two. They are Sanrio characters born on December 24th and introduced in 1975, which fits in line with their Christmas, angel-like designs. The characters were originally created by the designer Matsumoto with hopes of making a christmas-themed character, which they chose to use a star-themed collection.

<p>Thank you so much for reading my blog about my reflection of my Lunar New Year, and thoughts on my spring cleaning this cycle. It is definitely a tradition from my family that I hope to embrace, and this collection creates a digital archive to cherish these memories instead of leaving them just as waste alone. I hope you've taken something from this page or feel inspired to create one of your own!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
