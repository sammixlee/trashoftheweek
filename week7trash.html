<h2 id="sec-preface">Preface</h2>
<p>With the start of the Lunar New Year on <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/lunar-new-year-dates-animals-zodiac" target="_blank">January 29th</a>, families traditionally clean their homes to remove bad luck and begin the start of a new year– including my own family. After moving away for college, I've noticed I haven't followed this tradition much, a mix of college laziness and timing: after all, the semester has just started and my room would still be (pretty) in order. This year was different– I've just returned from a semester abroad, and had crammed all my things together to rush to college without ever really looking through what I brought! I thought it'd be a good time to do my own impromptu spring cleaning, as a way to bring back a hopeful tradition of spring cleaning as I prepare to move out of college and into an apartment of my own one day.</p>

<p>I've always been a bit of a sentimental hoarder, so this becomes a sweet little project where I'm able to reflect on my own changes and needs with time. I thought it'd make a more intriguing topic, seeing as all my trash I'm picking out this week holds more sentimental value to me than usual. Being able to let go of these small and pretty insignificant objects while recording them gives me a good way to look back on myself.</p>

<h2 id="sec-overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This week's disposal activity holds many more items of sentimental value as compared to previous weeks which are more of a reflection of my daily trash. Since it's a spring cleaning, these items took me a lot more thought to throw out, whether it was recorded for this project or not. My view of the project during this week feels much more personal and also made me rethink how much I hold onto even if I don't need them anymore.</p>

<h3>Makeup</h3>
<p>The first product I threw out is the green-gold Moroccan clay pot lipstick I got earlier this year. I realized the product doesn't work like how I'd like (and has also broken down enough that I can't pass it down). I kept it at first as a souvenir from my trip, but realized I really just keep it in my drawer and don't love its look if there's no function. My second item is an old Elf Concealer I bought in high school. The picture shows it's clearly expired, but I always put off throwing it out because I felt attached to how I used to use it for special occasions or going out with friends. Another is my favorite Colorpop Highlighter that I finished to the pan. Once I got a replacement, it was an easier decision to throw out, but I also put it off until I did.</p>

<h3>Clothes</h3>
<p>Clothes-wise, I added in a beret, a white dress, and a hoodie from Cape Cod. The beret I just don't like—a cheap version I got off a website when I was younger—and the white dress no longer fits me anymore. The hoodie holds the most memories for me since I got it on a camping trip with my family, but as I got older, I began to condense my souvenir collection into magnets and household items that aren't as variable to me as clothes and how they look on me.</p>

<h3>Trinkets</h3>
<p>Lastly, my category of trinkets includes a broken Tamagotchi Connect, my old driver's license, and a bottle of Kirkland Coconut Water. The Tamagotchi, pictured on the right, was something I couldn't bring myself to throw out for the longest time since my sister and I grew up playing on these. Recently, there was a re-release of the line, where I bought my sister and me a new one, and I finally threw the old one away.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading my blog on my week within the Lunar New Year. I hope you have enjoyed my items. I have definitely taken my own time to understand and reflect on these items I have thrown out.</p>
